/**
 * Calculates the maximum profit from stock prices,
 * allowing multiple transactions (buy/sell) as long as you don't hold more than one stock at a time.
 *
 * ðŸ”— LeetCode Link:
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150
 *
 * ðŸ§  Algorithm (Greedy Peak Valley Detection):
 * - Start with the first day's price as the initial buy.
 * - Whenever a price drop is detected, sell at the previous peak and reset the buy price.
 * - After the loop, if the last price is higher than the last buy price, sell it.
 *
 * ðŸ§® Time Complexity: O(n)
 * - Traverse the array once.
 *
 * ðŸ’¾ Space Complexity: O(1)
 * - No extra space used.
 *
 * ðŸŽ¯ Difficulty: Medium
 * - Slightly more intuitive than dynamic programming; based on trend following.
